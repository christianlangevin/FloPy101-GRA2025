# Python and FloPy Workflows for Groundwater Modeling

## Workshop Description

Python is a popular programming language that can be used by hydrogeologists to automate repetitive tasks, perform scientific analyses, create publication-quality graphics, and develop graphical animations of scientific data and model results. The purpose of this 2-hour workshop is to introduce participants to FloPy, a Python package for creating, running, and post-processing MODFLOW-based groundwater models.  Participants will be provided with software installation instructions prior to the workshop session.  Following a brief introduction, the workshop session will focus on live demonstrations of Python and FloPy workflows for performing common groundwater modeling tasks.
